# CNN-dogs_or_cats
 
I have used Convolutional Neural Network for this project of distinguishing between cats and dogs.

Since the folder containing pictures is too large (this was a custom folder containing dogs and cats), try Kaggle for similar datasets - https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats/data
